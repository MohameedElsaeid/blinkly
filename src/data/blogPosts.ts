        excerpt: "Discover creative strategies to encourage shoppers to scan QR codes in-store, turning casual browsers into engaged digital visitors.",
        content: `Imagine a shopper strolling through your store, eyes darting over products, when they spot a quirky sign next to a QR code that says “Scan me for a surprise!” Chances are, their curiosity will kick in – phone out, camera on, scan. In that moment, you’ve bridged the gap between the physical and digital shopping experience. QR codes are everywhere now, but how do you get those in-store customers to actually pull out their phones and scan? Today, we’re diving into fun and effective ways to motivate your in-store buyers to scan QR codes, turning casual browsers into engaged digital visitors.
Why Scanning QR Codes In-Store Matters
QR codes might look like just funky squares, but they can pack a serious punch for your business. With about 91% of U.S. adults owning a smartphone​

, scanning a QR code is as easy as taking a photo. Here’s why encouraging those scans can boost your store’s success:
Seamless shopper experiences: A quick scan can teleport customers to rich digital content – think product videos, reviews, or exclusive online deals – making their visit more interactive and personalized.
Faster checkouts & info access: From contactless payment links to digital menus or maps of your store, QR codes streamline tasks. Shoppers love convenience, and Blinkly QR codes can instantly deliver it (no app download needed).
Boosted loyalty and sales: A well-placed QR code with a tempting offer (like “Scan to get 20% off your next buy!”) can drive impulse purchases and repeat visits. It’s a nifty way to reward shoppers on the spot and encourage them to come back.
Trackable insights: Every scan is a treasure trove of data. Using Blinkly’s analytics, you can see how many people are engaging, when and where. These insights help you understand customer behavior and measure what in-store marketing is working.
5 Fun Ways to Encourage Shoppers to Scan
Okay, so we know scans are great – now how do we entice shoppers to actually do it? Simply slapping QR codes on walls won’t cut it. Here are some creative strategies to get those cameras clicking:
1. Tempt with Clear Call-To-Actions (CTAs)
Don’t leave folks guessing why they should scan. Pair every QR code with a short, punchy CTA that promises value. Skip the tech jargon and make it exciting. For example:
“Scan to unlock a surprise discount!”
“Scan me for a free gift!”
Place the text right above or next to the code, big and bold. When shoppers know exactly what’s in it for them, they’ll be itching to scan. Blinkly even lets you create custom QR code frames with text, so your CTA looks like part of the design (not just an afterthought).
2. Offer Instant Rewards or Exclusives
Who can resist a good freebie or deal? One of the best tricks to drive scans is offering an immediate reward. For example:
Discounts & Coupons: “Scan to save 15% now.” Put this on a fitting room mirror or product tag – making shoppers feel like VIPs with a secret deal.
Freebies: “Free coffee when you scan!” If you run a café, a code at the counter could give loyal sippers a free pastry on their next visit.
Loyalty Points: Integrate QR codes with your loyalty program. A restaurant might display a Blinkly QR code at each table; diners scan to earn points toward their next meal. It turns an ordinary dinner into a points-earning game.
These incentives create “oooh, what will I get?” anticipation. Customers are more likely to interact when there’s a fun reward waiting​

3. Make It On-Brand and Beautiful
A plain black-and-white QR code works, but a stylish, branded QR code works better. People trust things that look professional and familiar. With Blinkly, you can customize your QR codes – add your logo, match your brand colors, or pick a unique pattern. If your store’s vibe is playful and colorful, your QR codes should be too! By making QR codes a natural part of your store’s aesthetic (instead of an awkward tech add-on), customers will notice them more and associate scanning with your brand. It feels like a friendly invitation from you, rather than a random sticker.
4. Put QR Codes Where It Counts
Location, location, location! To maximize scans, place your QR codes in spots shoppers can’t miss:
At Product Displays: An eye-catching product display or end-cap is prime real estate. Add a QR code that gives more info or a demo video. Shoppers pausing there will be curious to scan.
In Fitting Rooms: (Captive audience alert!) While trying on clothes, a customer might scan a code for a style guide (“See outfit ideas for this item.”).
Checkout Counters: While people wait to pay, give them something to do. A QR code here could prompt signing up for your newsletter or loyalty program for a bonus. They’re already buying, so an extra perk is a nice cherry on top.
Just make sure codes are eye-level, in good lighting, and easy to scan (no one likes doing the awkward phone dance trying to capture a blurry code).
5. Get Your Staff Involved
Your store team can be QR code ambassadors. Encourage staff to mention the QR offers to shoppers. A simple “Pssst, scan that code by the entrance for a 20% off coupon” can nudge someone to give it a try. Staff can also help less tech-savvy shoppers by explaining how to use their phone camera to scan (though by now, most people know the drill). Enthusiasm is contagious – if your team is excited about Blinkly’s QR offers, customers will catch the vibe too.
Bringing Offline Shoppers Online (Wrap-Up)
In-store QR codes are like magic portals that bring offline shoppers into your online world. When used creatively, they not only enrich the shopping experience but also drive real results – more sales, sign-ups, and smiles. The key is to make scanning fun, easy, and rewarding. With Blinkly’s short links and dynamic QR codes, you have the power to track engagement and update content on the fly, ensuring those little squares always deliver big value. So next time you set up a QR code in your shop, remember to give people a reason to scan that they can’t refuse. A dash of curiosity, a sprinkle of incentive, and a splash of Blinkly branding – and you’ll see those in-store QR code scans (and your revenue) soar! Ready to turn your store into an interactive experience? Blinkly has you covered with customizable QR codes and link tracking. Give it a try and watch your customers connect with your brand like never before. Happy scanning!
The Ultimate Guide to Using QR Codes for Loyalty Programs
Remember the days of carrying punch cards or keychain tags for every coffee shop and grocery store loyalty program? 🗝️ Those days are fading fast. Now, your customers’ smartphones and a simple QR code can do the job with zero hassle. Welcome to the ultimate guide on blending QR codes with loyalty programs – a combo that’s boosting customer engagement and business revenue in a big way.
Why QR Codes Are a Loyalty Game-Changer
Loyalty programs are all about making customers feel valued and coming back for more. But here’s a reality check: while 81% of consumers join loyalty programs, only 49% actually use them actively​
WHITELABEL-LOYALTY.COM
. Why the drop-off? Often because traditional programs (think flimsy cards and tedious sign-ups) are a pain. QR codes to the rescue! Here’s how QR codes are revolutionizing loyalty programs:
Instant, hassle-free sign-ups: Instead of filling out forms or remembering to grab a paper application, shoppers can scan a Blinkly QR code to join your program in seconds. No pens, no typos – just tap and go.
No more forgotten cards: A QR code can turn a customer’s phone into their loyalty “card.” Whether it’s a code in an app, or a digital membership pass saved to their wallet, there’s nothing physical to lose or forget at home. (Bye-bye, overstuffed wallets!)
Real-time rewards: Customers hate waiting forever to earn something. With QR code scans, points and rewards can be applied in real time. For example, scan a code at checkout to immediately see points added – satisfying that need for instant gratification.
Seamless online-offline connection: QR codes bridge the gap between in-store and digital. Someone can scan in your store and instantly connect to your online platform – check their points balance, redeem an online coupon, or share feedback. It’s a smooth “phygital” experience (physical + digital) that today’s shoppers love.
Valuable data & tracking: Every scan is tracked, giving you insight into customer behavior. See which store location or which promotion drives the most sign-ups or redemptions. With Blinkly’s link analytics, each QR code or short link becomes a mini feedback machine telling you where and how customers engage. These insights help you tailor and improve your loyalty strategy over time.
Creative Ways to Use QR Codes in Your Loyalty Program
One of the best things about QR codes is their versatility—you can use them in various ways to engage customers and enhance loyalty programs. Here are just a few examples of how businesses can incorporate QR codes into their loyalty strategies:
QR Code loyalty cards for easy access: Ditch the bulky physical cards. Customers simply scan a QR code to add a digital loyalty card straight to their mobile wallet. Next time they’re at your store, they can pull out their phone and have their loyalty ID ready in a flash. No more “Oops, I forgot my card” – their membership is always on them. Plus, digital cards can update in real time with points and rewards.
In-store sign-ups at checkout: Place a sign with a QR code at your cash register or entrance that says “Join our loyalty program – Scan here!” Customers can quickly sign up on their phone while they wait in line. No paper forms, no awkward questions – just a quick digital signup. Blinkly links can drop them right onto a mobile-friendly enrollment page.
Scan to earn points: Make it fun to rack up rewards. Put a QR code on receipts or at self-checkout stations that customers can scan to claim points for their purchase (some brands even put a QR right on the product package so you can scan at home later and still get your points!). In a restaurant, you could print a unique QR code on each bill; when scanned, it confirms their visit and credits loyalty points. Who doesn’t love watching their points balance climb after a meal? It feels like a little victory every time they scan and see their balance go up!
Quick reward redemption: When it’s time to redeem rewards, QR codes make it painless. For example, email a member a QR code for 20% off – they show it and you scan it, done. Or let them pull up a reward QR code in your app to redeem a free item; no fiddling with coupon codes. Whether it’s scanning a code from a flyer or a phone screen, it’s faster and more foolproof than typing in promo codes or searching for emails.
Promote via packaging and print: Have you ever found a coupon in your mailbox and forgotten to use it? With QR codes, you can put loyalty sign-up or reward redemption codes right on your print materials. A flyer might say “Scan to join our VIP club” – turning a piece of paper into a digital gateway. Product packaging can feature a code that, when scanned post-purchase, gives loyalty points or a referral bonus. You’re essentially extending the loyalty program touchpoints to every channel.
Benefits: Why Your Business Will Love QR-Based Loyalty
By now you can imagine how much smoother a QR-powered loyalty program is for customers. But what’s in it for you, the business? (Spoiler: A lot.)
Higher sign-up rates: Lower friction means more people will actually join your program. Many shoppers who wouldn’t bother with a lengthy signup might scan a code for a quick join, especially if there’s an immediate perk (“Join now, get 100 points!”). More members = more repeat business potential.
Increased engagement & retention: When membership lives on their phone, customers engage more often. They’ll check the app or wallet pass frequently, and they won’t abandon the program simply because they forgot a card. More engagement = more chances to drive repeat sales.
Better customer data: When customers use their loyalty QR codes or links, you can track their purchases and preferences across online and offline channels. It’s like connecting the dots of their journey. This data helps you personalize offers (which 56% of customers say will keep them coming back​
WHITELABEL-LOYALTY.COM
). For example, you might notice a customer scans for vegetarian recipes, so you send them a special veggie-lover discount.
Cost savings & eco-friendly: Ditching physical cards and brochures saves money on printing (and is kinder to the planet 🌳). Plus, updating a digital program is way easier – you can change the landing page behind a Blinkly QR code any time, rather than reprinting new materials.
Word-of-mouth growth: Those referral QR codes or short links can bring in new customers with minimal effort. People trust friends more than ads, so a shared loyalty invite via a personalized Blinkly link is marketing gold. Your loyal customers effectively become your brand ambassadors, and you track every referral.
Getting Started: Tips for a Successful QR Code Loyalty Program

Make it mobile-friendly: Ensure the pages your QR codes lead to (sign-up forms, reward pages) are optimized for smartphones. If it’s Blinkly, don’t worry – our dynamic links can point to responsive pages or even directly trigger app actions.
Educate customers (briefly): Some shoppers might need a hint. A little nudge like “Open your camera to scan & join” on signage can help those unfamiliar with QR codes. Thankfully, most people know how it works now.
Test the flow: Before rolling out, test the entire experience. Scan as if you’re a customer: is the sign-up quick? Does the point addition show up correctly? Iron out any hiccups so it’s smooth sailing for users.
Promote the heck out of it: Let customers know your loyalty program just got easier. Announce it on social media, in email newsletters, and right in your store. Show off the QR sign-up option and the cool rewards they can get.

        excerpt: "Explore how print marketing can thrive in our digital age by leveraging QR codes and short links to create measurable, engaging campaigns.",
        content: `
# How Does Print Marketing Fit Into a Digital World?

"Print is dead," they said. "Everyone is glued to screens now," they said. And yet – have you checked your mail or picked up a flyer lately? Print marketing is very much alive, but it's no longer just about traditional ink on paper. In our hyper-digital age, print has found a new groove by teaming up with digital tools like short links and QR codes. The result? Old-school media with a modern twist, driving people online and delivering measurable results. Let's explore how print marketing fits (and thrives) in today's digital landscape.

## Print's Unique Strengths (Yes, People Still Read Paper!)

Despite the dominance of Facebook ads and email campaigns, print materials – from postcards and brochures to billboards – offer something digital ads often can't: tangibility and trust. A physical mailer or a glossy catalog engages more senses, making it memorable. 

In fact, a huge portion of folks will at least skim the mail they get; around 42% of direct mail recipients either read or scan the mail they receive. That's a big deal in an era when many of us ignore overflowing email inboxes. Print also tends to feel more personal and credible. A survey found 71% of consumers feel direct mail is more personal than online digital ads. There's something about holding a piece of mail with your name on it that builds trust. This trust often translates into action – ever kept a coupon from a flyer on your fridge? You're not alone. 

However, traditional print alone has a limitation: it's hard to track and it's not instantly interactive. This is where our digital sidekicks come in.

## Bridging Print and Digital: The Best of Both Worlds

To make print marketing thrive today, you need to bridge that offline-online gap. The goal is to use print to drive customers to engage digitally, where you can track engagement and continue the conversation. Here's how Blinkly and a bit of strategy can help:

### Include Short Links

Long URLs on a poster? No thanks. Instead, use a short, branded URL (generated by Blinkly, naturally) that is easy to type and remember. For example, instead of printing "www.yourstore.com/summer-sale-coupon-2025", print "yourbrand.link/summer". Not only does it look cleaner, but you can track how many people actually visit it. Every time someone types in that short link from your flyer, Blinkly will count it – giving you instant feedback on your print campaign's reach.

### Add QR Codes for Instant Action

QR codes have become super popular (thanks, smartphone evolution). Placing a QR code on your print material makes it effortless for readers to jump online. Someone sees your poster, scans the code, and boom – they're watching your promo video or signing up on your site. No typing required. 

Plus, QR codes make print interactive: you can lead customers to anything – a signup page, a discount code, a product demo – turning a static print piece into a gateway for dynamic content. And yes, Blinkly's QR codes will let you track those scans too.

### Personalized Print URLs (PURLs)

For high-end campaigns (like a targeted direct mail-out), you can even use unique short URLs or QR codes per recipient. For example, Jane Doe's postcard has blink.ly/JaneVIP which is different from John Smith's blink.ly/JohnVIP. When they visit, you know exactly who responded. This might sound advanced, but it's an amazing way to track ROI for big campaigns. (And it can all be managed through a good link management platform.)

By combining print with digital calls-to-action, you effectively turn analog marketing into digital. You get the attention and trust benefits of print, and the data and interactivity of digital.

## Why This Combination Works

Mixing print and digital isn't just a cool trick – it delivers better results than doing either alone. Consider this: one study showed that using both email and print catalogs in a campaign boosted sales by 49%, whereas an email-only approach saw about a 28% lift. In other words, print + digital = a one-two punch for conversions. Here are a few reasons print integrated with digital is a marketing power couple:

### Wider Audience Reach

Not everyone is ultra-connected 24/7. Print can reach people who might miss your email or social post. And if they are always online, well, now they see you in the physical world too – multiple touchpoints!

### Reinforcement and Recall

Seeing a message in print and then seeing it online (or vice versa) makes it stickier. It's subtle psychology – repetition across channels boosts brand recall. A customer might read your mailed brochure, then later see your online ad and think, "Oh yeah, I remember this brand," and be more likely to click.

### Immediate Engagement, Measurable Results

Old print ads were hard to measure – you'd put out a billboard and hope people show up. Now, with a scannable code or short link, you can measure exactly how many viewers took action. And those actions happen instantly – a scan takes them right to your digital storefront where they can make a purchase or sign up.

### Higher Response Rates

Believe it or not, direct mail and print ads can get high response rates, especially when combined with digital convenience. The average direct mail response rate is about 4.4% vs just 0.12% for email. That's huge. If you can capture those responses online (say, via a Blinkly short link that leads to your site), you can capitalize on that interest immediately.

## Tips to Make Print-Digital Marketing Work

1. **Always include a Call-to-Action**: Every print piece should tell the reader what to do next – "Visit our site," "Scan to get 20% off," "Follow us for updates." Make that CTA prominent and clear.

2. **Keep It Short and Simple**: Whether it's a URL or a message, brevity is your friend. That's why short links are key – nobody wants to type a novel into their browser.

3. **Design with Scanning in Mind**: If you use a QR code, make sure it's big enough and has some white space around it. Add a small caption like "Scan me!" so people know it's interactive. And test it – make sure it scans well before printing 10,000 copies.

4. **Track and Analyze**: Use Blinkly (or your preferred platform) to monitor those link clicks and QR scans. This data will show you which print media are performing. Maybe you'll find that the QR code on page 2 of the magazine got more scans than the one on page 10 – insight you can use to improve placement or design next time.

## Conclusion: Print's New Life in the Digital Age

So, how does print marketing fit into a digital world? Perfectly – when they work together. Print is no longer an isolated medium; it's a launchpad to digital engagement. By leveraging tools like branded short links and dynamic QR codes, Blinkly helps bring your print materials into the 21st century, complete with analytics and optimization.

The bottom line: Don't toss out print as "old news." Instead, supercharge it with digital integrations. You might send out postcards, but those postcards can lead to online sales funnels and trackable results. In a marketing landscape that's increasingly online, a tangible printed piece – backed by smart links – can cut through the noise and drive customers right where you want them.

Ready to blend offline and online marketing? Give Blinkly a whirl to create trackable short URLs and QR codes for all your print campaigns. Watch as your brochures and banners start generating clicks, conversions, and real ROI in our digital world. Print isn't dead – it just put on a digital superhero cape!
